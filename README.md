# Power modeller
This R project contains a power model generator for energy assessment.
Power estimation and prediction is valid for heterogeneous applications with different patterns of resource usage and energy consumption. The tool selects systematically a minimum set of resource usage indicators and extracts complex relations among them, capturing the impact on energy consumption of all the resources in the system.
